# Scala

- Scala is an object-oriented and functional programming language.
- It is a strong static type language.
- In scala, everything is an object whether it is a function or a number. It does not have concept of primitive data.
- Scala is influenced by Java.
- File extension of scala source file may be either .scala or .sc.
- You can create any kind of application like web application,
enterprise application, mobile application, desktop based application
etc.
- Scala programs can convert to bytecodes and can run on the
JVM(Java Virtual Machine). Scala stands for Scalable language.

## Features of scala

- **Object-Oriented:** Every value in Scala is an object so it is a purely object-oriented programming language.
- **Functional:** It is also a functional programming language as every function is a value type; every value is an object. It provides the support for the high-order functions, nested functions, anonymous functions etc.
- **Statically Typed:** The process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types is done at compile time in Scala.
- **Extensible:** New language constructs can be added to Scala in form of libraries.
- **Concurrent & Synchronize Processing:** Scala allows the user to write the codes in an immutable manner that makes it easy to apply the parallelism(Synchronize) and concurrency.

- **Type inference**
  - Don't require to mention data type and function return type explicitly.
- **Singleton object**
  - In Scala, there are no static variables or methods. Scala uses singleton object, which is essentially class with only one object in the source file. Singleton object is declared by using `object` instead of `class` keyword.
- **Immutability**
  - NO modification
- **Lazy computation**
  - Scala evaluates expressions only when they are required
- **Concurrency control**
  - Standard library support for concurrency control
- **String interpolation**
  - Scala offers a new mechanism to create strings from your data. It is called string interpolation.
- **Rich collection set**
  - rich set of collection library to support data collection.
